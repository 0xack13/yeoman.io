Note: we have been using Google Docs for our meeting notes over the past year, but are currently experimenting with using the wiki for this. It improves open-ness and can be referenced more easily.

## Wednesday, 15th Jan

* Official [generator](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1263) cleanup - can we add references to .yo-rc examples?
* `grunt serve` is the new hotness. Thanks to Eddie for his PRs, Sindre for merging. Tag/release new versions this week.
* Dynamically selecting the new available port for connection [PR](https://github.com/eddiemonge/grunt-contrib-connect/commit/7bd5022e4b5f53919f0fc94e0501548dd3ef666b) - changes of this landing upstream?
* Simon started work on bringing [queues](https://github.com/yeoman/generator/pull/468) to the generator system. Next up is priority queues. Feedback would be appreciated on the [composability](https://github.com/yeoman/generator/issues/433) discussion thread. 
* Addy is working on defining the [roadmap](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1264) for this quarter. PR for bringing back RequireJS and defining the roadmap for this quarter, how we might help [existing](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1265) projects.
* Documentation [sprint](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1259) plans. How do we want to run this? Dedicated day? Time? In-person? Would be great to knock out some revised docs soon.
* Find out where we are with [grunt-reduce](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1234) and the asset graph work being done by Peter.
