# Meet Yeoman

Yeoman is a man in a hat with tricks up his sleeve.

With just a command or two, Yeoman can write boilerplate code for your app (or individual pieces like Models), compile your Sass, and fire up a simple web server in your current directory. It can also: run your unit tests; minimize and concatenate your CSS, JS, and HTML; optimize images; plus more.

Yeoman comes with three tools for improving your productivity:

* [**yo**](http://yeoman.io) is a scaffolding tool that offers an ecosystem of framework-specific scaffolds, called generators, that can be used to perform some of the tedious tasks mentioned earlier.

* [**grunt**](http://gruntjs.com) is used to build, preview and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and [grunt-contrib](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib).

* [**bower**](http://bower.io) is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download your front-end libraries.

You can install Yeoman generators using the [npm](http://npmjs.org) command and there are over [450 generators](http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html) now available, many of which have been written by the open-source community. Popular generators include [generator-angular](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular), [generator-backbone](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-backbone) and [generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember).


## Why use Yeoman?

With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on a workflow that you’re happy with is often a very personal endeavour, but getting started isn’t always easy. Yeoman aims to solve this problem by scaffolding workflows for creating modern webapps, while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry.
