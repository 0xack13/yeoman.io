# Congratulations!

In this code lab, you learned how to:

* Scaffold out the boilerplate for an application using `yo` and Yeoman generators.

* Install dependencies to improve the functionality in your app with `bower`.

* Use `grunt serve` to build and preview an interim version of our app. All our edits resulted in a live reload of the page giving us a nice real-time view of what we authored, along with any JavaScript syntax errors.

* Write a simple Angular app and learned about common directives like ng-model, ng-repeat, ng-click, and ng-submit.

* Update unit tests for Angular apps to make sure your code is maintainable over time.

* Prepare an application for production by minifying and concatenating files.

## Like what you see? Yeoman can do more.

Yeoman supports scaffolding out a lot more for Angular and other frameworks than we’ve shown today.

For example, the Angular generator also supports creating new views, directives and controllers for you. A new controller can be scaffolded by running `yo angular:controller controllerName`, which will create your controller files but also update the route in app.js for you. We also try scaffolding out unit tests where possible.

To find out all the Yeoman commands for the Angular generator take a look at the [generator readme](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme).

## Where to go next

* **AngularJS** ([angularjs.org](http://angularjs.org)) helped us write this Todo app quickly and with elegance. To dig deeper into the sweet spots of AngularJS, take a look at the detailed [documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/overview).

* **Grunt** ([gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com)) has tasks for almost anything you might like to do with your app, whether it’s [compiling CoffeeScript](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass) or [hooking up your app to custom middleware](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect) like PHP or Express. Your Yeoman app already has a Gruntfile.js already set up for you so read up on how to configure more Grunt tasks [here](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks).

* Bower ([bower.io](http://bower.io)) has a growing collection of easily installable packages for adding capabilities to your app. View all the packages available through Bower's registry [here](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/).

* Yeoman is always evolving. Be sure to checkout [yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io) for more information and follow [@yeoman](https://twitter.com/yeoman) and [+Yeoman](https://plus.sandbox.google.com/101063139999404044459/posts) to stay up to date.

That’s it from your man-in-a-hat for now. Thanks!
