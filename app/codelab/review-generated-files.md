# Review the Yeoman-generated app

Open up your "mytodo" directory to take a look at what was actually scaffolded. We have:

* **app**: a parent directory for our web application

    * **index.html**: the base html file for our Angular app
    * **404.html**, **favicon.ico**, and **robots.txt**: commonly used web files so you donâ€™t have to create them yourself
    * **bower_components**: a home for our JavaScript/web dependencies, installed by Bower
    * **scripts**: our own JS files
        * **app.js**: our main application code
        * **controllers**: our Angular controllers
    * **styles**: our CSS files
    * **views**: a place for our Angular templates

* **Gruntfile.js**, **package.json,** and **node_modules**: configuration and dependencies required by our Grunt tasks

* **test** and **karma.conf.js**/**karma-e2e.conf.js**: a scaffolded out test runner and the unit tests for the project, including boilerplate tests for our controllers.
